A cartoon exterior hides a suprisingly technical and tricky fighter.

Before I even owned it, my love for this game came from 2 sources.

First off the Super Punch-Out!! Nintendo Arcade game _1984_. This was a mammoth machine with two screens and some really loud speakers. It used that futuristic green wireframe style for your boxer and the graphics used that ultra sharp style that Nintendo first used on Popeye in the arcade. It was a great machine, but it was usually expensive so I used to mainly watch other kids play.

Next there was Frank Bruno's Boxing on the Spectrum (Elite ?year?)
